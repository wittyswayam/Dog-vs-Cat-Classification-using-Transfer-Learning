🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction








This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using supervised machine learning techniques. The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular beginner-level datasets on Kaggle, often used to demonstrate the process of building a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline.

🔑 Project Workflow

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Imputed missing values (Age, Fare, Embarked)

Encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)

Engineered features like Family Size and Title extraction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Survival rates across gender, class, and age

Correlation heatmaps & bar plots

Strongest predictors: Sex, Pclass, Age

Feature Engineering

Binned continuous variables (Age, Fare)

Combined class & gender features for stronger signals

Model Development

Algorithms tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM

Hyperparameter tuning + cross-validation

Random Forest achieved best accuracy
